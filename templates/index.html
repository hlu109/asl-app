    This is a proof-of-concept web application for digital flashcards tailored
    for practicing ASL (American Sign Language). As a minimal working example,
    it allows users to create new flashcard decks, populate the decks with
    flashcards, choose among multiple ASL sign variations for each term, and
    practice the flashcards using the spaced-repetition technique for better
    information retention.
  </p>

  <p>
    Existing general-purpose flashcard applications are not well-suited for
    efficiently managing large quantities of visual elements, which is necessary
    to ASL as a visual language. This app solves that issue by connecting
    directly to an ASL dictionary (<a href="https://www.signingsavvy.com/"
      >signingsavvy.com</a
    >). Furthermore, while there are a few ASL flashcard apps already out there,
    we do not know of any that implement spaced repetition, which is common in
    many general-purpose flashcard or language apps like Anki or Duolingo.

    This app is developed using Flask and hosted on AWS. Find the source code on
    <a href="https://github.com/hlu109/asl-app">github</a>.

    Disclaimer: The developers of this app are both Hearing. This is simply a
    project to fill a personal niche problem - practicing ASL vocabulary at a
    customized pace - and is not intended to teach ASL, replace a language class
    with a qualified instructor, or substitute for immersion in the Deaf/HoH
    community.
