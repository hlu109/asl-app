Note: this application only works on computer browsers and was not designed for mobile devices. 

This is a proof-of-concept web application for digital flashcards tailored for practicing American Sign Language. Users can create new flashcard decks, populate the decks with flashcards, choose among multiple ASL sign variations for each term, and practice the flashcards using the spaced-repetition technique for better information retention.

Existing general-purpose flashcard applications are not well-suited for efficiently managing large quantities of visual elements, which is necessary to ASL as a visual language. This app solves that issue by connecting directly to an ASL dictionary ([signingsavvy.com](https://www.signingsavvy.com/)). Furthermore, while there are a few ASL flashcard apps already out there, we do not know of any that implement spaced repetition, which is common in many general-purpose flashcard or language apps like Anki or Duolingo.

This app is developed using Flask and hosted on AWS.

Disclaimer: The developers of this app are both Hearing. This is simply a project to fill a personal niche problem - practicing ASL vocabulary at a customized pace - and is not intended to teach ASL, replace a language class with a qualified instructor, or substitute for immersion in the Deaf/HoH community.
